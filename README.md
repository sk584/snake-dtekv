# snake-dtekv
A simple Snake game written in C, designed to run on the DTEK-V board. 
The game uses the board’s VGA output, timer interrupts, push button, switches, and 7-segment displays.

This project was developed collaboratively with another course mate.

Low-level startup files were provided by the course instructor and are not included in this repository.
